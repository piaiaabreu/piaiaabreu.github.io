I am a researcher focused on understanding economics as a complex system. My work bridges theory and practice, using advanced methodologies such as network analysis to explore challenges in economic systems and policy-making. Beyond traditional microfounded approaches, I investigate macroeconomics through the lens of complexity, emphasizing the dynamic interplay of agents, institutions, and networks in shaping economic outcomes.

    My interests lie at the intersection of classical liberal economic thought, systemic resilience, and the implications of institutional design on economics outcomes. Currently, I dedicate my efforts to developing innovative tools and frameworks that address pressing economic and political issues, striving to bring clarity and actionable insights to complex problems.
