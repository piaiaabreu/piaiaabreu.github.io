I am a researcher focused on understanding economics as a complex system. My work bridges theory and practice, using advanced methodologies such as network analysis to explore challenges in economic systems and policy-making.

      Beyond traditional microfounded approaches, I investigate macroeconomics through the lens of complexity, emphasizing the dynamic interplay of agents, institutions, and networks in shaping economic outcomes. My interests lie at the intersection of classical liberal economic thought, systemic resilience, and the institutional determinants of economic performance. I dedicate my efforts to developing innovative tools and frameworks that address pressing economic and political issues, striving to bring clarity and actionable insights to complex problems.

Currently, I serve as __Director of Productivity Enhancement at the Secretariat of Economic Development of the State of SÃ£o Paulo__, where I work on shaping and putting into practice policies that advance economic freedom, boost productivity, and encourage entrepreneurship. My role involves overseeing efforts to simplify regulations, evaluating their impact, promoting dialogue between the public and private sectors, and helping municipalities adopt initiatives that improve the business environment.
