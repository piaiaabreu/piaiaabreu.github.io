## [Research Manager, Students For Liberty](https://studentsforliberty.org/blog/staff/mariana-piaia/)

* Learn Liberty (YouTube Channel)
  * I create content centered on classical liberalism, connecting timeless principles of individual freedom, free markets, and limited government to contemporary issues. My goal is to foster insightful discussions and make these ideas accessible to a broad audience.
  
* The Invisible Lens (YouTube Channel)
  * I analyze pop culture—movies, series, cartoons, and music—through the framework of classical liberalism. By exploring the philosophical and economic themes behind popular stories, I reveal how entertainment reflects and shapes our understanding of freedom, society, and human nature.

* Cryptocurrency Freedom Index
  * A tool to evaluate and compare how different countries regulate cryptocurrencies in four critical areas—taxation, anti-money laundering (AML/CFT), consumer protection, and licensing.
  * This project aims to inform policymakers, businesses, and researchers about how regulation shapes the adoption and economic impact of cryptocurrencies globally.
