## [Research Manager, Students For Liberty](https://studentsforliberty.org/blog/staff/mariana-piaia/)

* Learn Liberty (YouTube Channel  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/learnliberty" target="_blank" title="YouTube"><i class="fab fa-youtube"></i></a>)
  * At Learn Liberty, I work on crafting content that connects classical liberal principles and economic ideas to everyday life. Through clear explanations and engaging discussions, I aim to inspire meaningful dialogue about freedom, markets, and the institutions that shape our society.
  
* The Invisible Lens (YouTube Channel  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwYitjvEl8hms8gFUFHp2Mw" target="_blank" title="YouTube"><i class="fab fa-youtube"></i></a>)
  * The Invisible Lens is where I explore the intersection of pop culture and deeper societal dynamics. By analyzing movies, series, cartoons, and music, I uncover how these stories reflect and influence our understanding of economics, philosophy, and the world around us..

* Cryptocurrency Freedom Index
  * A tool to evaluate and compare how different countries regulate cryptocurrencies in four critical areasâ€”taxation, anti-money laundering (AML/CFT), consumer protection, and licensing. This project aims to inform policymakers, businesses, and researchers about how regulation shapes the adoption and economic impact of cryptocurrencies globally.
